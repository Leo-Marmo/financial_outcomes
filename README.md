## Abstract <br>
This paper investigates the long-term financial outcomes of companies that were formally private equity-backed by assessing the financial performance of these companies post-private equity exit. Private equity companies rely mostly on private-to-private sale, private-to-public acquisition, or IPO to exit from their investments. Since the two former exit strategies do not always require public disclosure of financials upon exit, I rely on companies that IPO'd from 2010 through 2018 to base my analysis on. The analysis is broken into two sections. The first analysis, which utilizes an OLS regression, compares the growth rates of company financial metrics to companies that IPO'd during the same time frame that were not private equity-backed. The second analysis is an event study that seeks to find if private equity-backed companies experience similar growth rates post-IPO as they were prior to exit.
